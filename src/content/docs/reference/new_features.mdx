### Pokedex system
The Hearth Pokedex has a completely revamped system for obtainging information on pokemon. When you catch a new pokemon you won't get all the information on it. Instead as you explore the world you will encounter tidbits of information about various pokemon which you'll automatically "note down" in the pokedex. Explore everywhere to complete your pokedex. 

##### Silly Names
When a pokemon is encountered for the first time, it's name is not known to you. Instead the pokemon is refered to by a palceholder "silly name". Such as Joltik being called Little Spark. When you read or hear someone say a pokemon's name in the overworld you learn the name and the silly name will be replaced with the real name. Catching a pokemon will automatically have the player discover it's actual name.

### Color Variants
Each individual pokemon has a unique hue variation depending on the personality (a hidden internal value). These are not the same as shinies. They're much more common and are unique to each individual pokemon (not the species)

### Shiny Pokemon
Shiny Pokemon exist like they do in mainline pokemon games. These are independent of the hue variations. Shiny pokemon will sparkle when sent out and will be marked by a star in the summary screen. 

The shiny odds are `1/4096` like in the mainline games post Generation 6. THis is about twice the rate in Pokemon Emerald.
