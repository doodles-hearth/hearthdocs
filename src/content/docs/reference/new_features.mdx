### PokéDex system
The Hearth PokéDex has a custom system for obtaining information on Pokémon. When you catch a new Pokémon, you won't get all the information on it. As you explore the world, you will find tidbits of information about various Pokémon which you'll automatically "write down" in the PokéDex. Explore everywhere to complete your PokéDex.

#### "Silly Names"
When a Pokémon is encountered for the first time, its name is not known to you. Instead the Pokémon is refered to by a placeholder "silly name". Such as Joltik being called Little Spark. When you read or hear someone say a Pokémon's name in the overworld, you write it down in your PokéDex, and the silly name will be replaced with the real name. Catching a Pokémon will automatically have the player discover its actual name.

### Field Move System
Pokémon Hearth replaces the standard HM system with field moves, which are categories of moves that can be used in the field.

Example: Once you are granted the ability to smash rocks, you'll be able to use any moves that smash rocks, such as Brick Break, to smash rocks in the field.

The following non-damaging Scrolls (TMs) serve as field moves in case the player has nothing else:

- Nick (Cut)
- Push (Strength)
- Pebble Crush (Rock Smash)
- Splash (Surf)
- Sink (Dive)
- Water Fail (Waterfall)

### Color Variations
Each individual Pokémon has a unique hue variation depending on its personality (a hidden internal value). These are not the same as shinies.

:::note[A note on shinies]
**Shiny Pokémon** exist like they do in mainline Pokémon games. These are independent of the hue variations. Shiny Pokémon will sparkle when sent out and will be marked by a star in the summary screen.
The shiny odds are `1/4096` like in the mainline games post Generation 6.
