## Before Playing
---

##### Where do I get the game?
At [**Team Aqua's Patch Cove**](https://teamaquashideout.github.io/tah-patchsite/hacks/hearth). You can apply the patch to a clean dump of Pokémon Emerald straight from the site or download the patch and do it. **This is the ONLY place to get the official patches.**

:::caution[Why you shouldn't get Hearth from any other website]
By downloading the patch or a pre-patched ROM from a non-official source, **you can end up with an outdated version of the game**.
:::

##### What is a patch?
Romhacks can't be shared freely because they contain intellectual property not owned by the creators. Instead we share patch files that isolate only the changes we make to the base rom. These patch files are applied over the original game (in this case Pokémon Emerald).

##### Where do I get a clean rom of Emerald?
Unforunately we CANNOT tell you where to get that. Please do so on your own. We trust that you will obtain said rom legally before patching Hearth over it.

##### Can I get a prepatched rom?
NO. This is illegal and can get the server and developers in trouble. You must find a clean Emerald Rom yourself.

##### Will cheats for vanilla Emerald work?
NO. This hack changes far too many things. Using cheats can and will break your save file. Use them at your own peril and please DO NOT make bug reports if you do.

##### I found a bug. What do I do?
Make a report in the ⁠bug-report🐛 channel. Make sure to read the PINNED POST before you do. And check if the bug has been reported before.


## About The Game
---
##### How complete is the game?
In the current demo you can play up to the third gym. This hack is in active development.

##### Does this hack have documentation?
Not at the moment.

##### Is there a release date for the full version?
Not that we know of. Hacks take a lot of time to make so please be patient. Updates will be posted in the Discord server.

##### What is a Pokémon Refuge? Where are the Pokémon Centers?
That's just what we call Pokémon Centers. You'll find them in most towns.

## New Features
---

##### How does the PokéDex work?
As you play, you will discover bits of information about each Pokémon, which will be added to the Dex. Explore everywhere and talk to people to fill up the PokéDex entries. Find out more [here](/reference/new_features)!

##### What are these silly names for Pokémon? What is a Little Spark?
Until you learn the actual name of a Pokémon, you'll see its silly name instead. Catch a Pokémon or hear/read its name to discover it!

##### Why do some Pokémon have different colors? Are they shiny?
Each Pokémon has a unique, slightly different hue! These are NOT the same as shiny Pokémon. Shiny Pokémon still exist.
