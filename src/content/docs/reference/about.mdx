### Basics

Pokémon Hearth is meant to be a **cozy adventure set in a brand new region**. The difficulty level is somewhat comparable to vanilla Pokémon games.

:::note
Currently **the demo goes up to the third gym**, the rest of the game is under development.

### The Toku Region
Pokémon Hearth takes place in the Toku Region, (freely) inspired by ancient China & Japan. Toku features diverse biomes such as forests, mountains, caves, open sea and volcanos.

### A Living, breathing world
Hearth features an **internally managed clock**; the in-game time is not dependent on actual time. The player can sleep at Pokémon Refuges to pass time. The world of Hearth will react to the in-game clock as NPCs have different schedules. For instance, Shamisen Players take shelter in Pokémon Refuges at night, while the School is only open during the day.

### Learnsets
Hearth uses the Pokémon XY Learnsets as a fallback for all Pokémon who don't have custom learnsets. The custom learnsets are not yet documented.
